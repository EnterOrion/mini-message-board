# Mini Message Board

## About

This is my first project using Node.js! It's pretty small, but you can read messages that other users have posted and send a message yourself.

## Tools

The frontend is very minimal, but the backend was built with Node.js and Express. Express validator was used to validate form data. <br/> Luxon was used to format dates of the messages. MongoDB was used as the database. EJS was used as the template engine.
