# Mini Message Board

## About

This is my first project using Node.js! It's pretty small, but you can read messages that other users have posted and send a message yourself.

## Tools

The frontend is very minimal, but the backend was built with Node.js and Express. Express validator was used to validate form data. Luxon was used to format dates of the messages. MongoDB was used as the database.
